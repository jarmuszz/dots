# You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex.
# Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have
# answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of
# regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that
# is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML.
# HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular
# expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its
# meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced
# irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing
# HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity
# that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse
# HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with
# regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian
# hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the
# realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual
# infanticide. The <center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and
# HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much
# watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their
# blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name
# cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regxp
# will liquify the n​erves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche
# withering in the onslaught of horror. Rege̿̔̉x-based HTML parsers are the cancer
# that is killinge
